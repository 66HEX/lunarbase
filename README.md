## Configuration

### CLI Configuration (Primary Method)

Use the CLI for all server configuration:

```bash
# Show CLI help
cargo run -- --help

# Show serve command help
cargo run serve --help

# Start with defaults (127.0.0.1:3000)
cargo run serve

# Custom host and port  
cargo run serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080

# Enable TLS
cargo run serve --tls --tls-cert /path/to/cert.pem --tls-key /path/to/key.pem

# API-only mode
cargo run serve --api-only --port 9000
```

### Environment Variables (.env file)

Create a `.env` file for non-server settings based on the provided `env.example` template.

### Required Configuration

#### Database Configuration
```bash
DATABASE_URL=db.sqlite         # SQLite database file path
SQLCIPHER_KEY=your-strong-encryption-password  # Database encryption key
```

#### Security Settings
```bash
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
PASSWORD_PEPPER=your-super-secret-pepper-change-this-in-production-and-keep-it-secret
```

#### Admin User Setup
```bash
LUNARBASE_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com      # Initial admin email
LUNARBASE_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin               # Initial admin username
LUNARBASE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-admin-password  # Initial admin password
```

**Note:** These variables automatically create an admin user on first startup. Only the first admin can be created this way - subsequent admins must be created through the admin panel.

### Optional Configuration

#### Email Service (Resend)
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=your-resend-api-key-from-resend-dashboard  # Get from https://resend.com
EMAIL_FROM=onboarding@resend.dev                          # Sender email address
```

#### OAuth Authentication
```bash
# Google OAuth (from Google Cloud Console)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id-from-google-cloud-console
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret-from-google-cloud-console

# GitHub OAuth (from GitHub Developer Settings)
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-client-id-from-github-developer-settings
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-client-secret-from-github-developer-settings
```

#### S3 File Storage
```bash
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name           # S3 bucket for file uploads
S3_REGION=us-east-1                       # AWS region
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id       # AWS access key
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key  # AWS secret key
# S3_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:4566   # Optional: Custom endpoint (LocalStack)
```

**Note:** All S3 variables are optional. If not set, file upload functionality will be disabled.

### Security Best Practices

- **Use strong, unique passwords** for `SQLCIPHER_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`, and `PASSWORD_PEPPER`
- **Never commit secrets** to version control - use `.env` files locally and secure environment variable management in production
- **Rotate secrets regularly** especially JWT secrets and database encryption keys
- **Use HTTPS in production** by using `--tls` flag with valid SSL certificates

## Quick Start

### Development Mode

```bash
# Install dependencies
cargo build

# Start LocalStack for S3 testing (required for file upload functionality)
./start-with-localstack.sh

# Start the backend server with CLI
cargo run serve
# OR for development with custom settings:
cargo run serve --host localhost --port 3001

# In a separate terminal, start the admin interface
cd admin-ui
npm install
npm run dev

# Test WebSocket connections (in another terminal)
# With TLS enabled:
wscat -c wss://localhost:3000/api/ws --no-check

# With TLS disabled:
wscat -c ws://localhost:3000/api/ws

# Run unit and integration tests (in another terminal)
cargo test -- --test-threads=1

# Format code after modifications:
# Frontend (use biome.js for linting and formatting)
cd admin-ui && npx @biomejs/biome check --write

# Backend (use cargo fmt for code formatting)
cargo fmt

# Stop LocalStack when done
./stop-localstack.sh
```
#### Access Points

### Production Mode

#### Prerequisites

**1. Environment Configuration**
Create a `.env` file with required configuration. Copy from `env.example` and customize:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

**Required .env variables:**
- `DATABASE_URL` - SQLite database file path
- `SQLCIPHER_KEY` - Strong encryption password for database

- `PASSWORD_PEPPER` - Additional security layer for password hashing
- `LUNARBASE_ADMIN_EMAIL` - Initial admin user email
- `LUNARBASE_ADMIN_USERNAME` - Initial admin username
- `LUNARBASE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Initial admin password

**Optional but recommended:**
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - For email verification (get from https://resend.com)
- `EMAIL_FROM` - Sender email address
- OAuth credentials (Google/GitHub)
- S3 configuration for file uploads

**2. CLI Configuration**

Server settings are configured via CLI arguments:

```bash
# Basic server setup
./lunarbase serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 443

# With TLS for production
./lunarbase serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 443 --tls --tls-cert /path/to/cert.pem --tls-key /path/to/key.pem
```

#### Build and Deploy

```bash
# Build the application with embedded admin UI
cargo build --release

# Start the production server with CLI (serves both API and embedded admin UI)
./target/release/lunarbase serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000

# Or with TLS for production
./target/release/lunarbase serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 443 --tls --tls-cert /etc/ssl/cert.pem --tls-key /etc/ssl/key.pem
```

**Note:** The admin UI is automatically built and embedded into the binary during compilation. No separate frontend build step is required.
